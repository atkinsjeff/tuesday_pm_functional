README for analysis of NEON LiDAR data from the Teakettle Field Site
Code written by J.Atkins for #NEONDI16 (NEON Data Institute)

email:  jeffatkins@virginia.edu

This code expected to have a directory of data that is sibiling to, but not located in this repo due to the large size of the data files associated with this analysis--limiting inclusion in the repo. 

Output files are set to go into the /output folder sub this directory.
